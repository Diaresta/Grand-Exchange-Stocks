### Old School RuneScape Grand Exchange Market Watch

---

_**ge.teller**_ is a tool to assist players in traversing the [OldSchool RuneScape](https://oldschool.runescape.com) _Grand Exchange_. We congregate data from the official [OldSchool RuneScape](https://oldschool.runescape.com) and [OSRS Wiki](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki) APIs to provide players with up to date item information. _**ge.teller's**_ buy/sell feature provides players a medium to make mock item transactions, allowing them to track their purchase history, speculate market trends, and practice playing the market.
